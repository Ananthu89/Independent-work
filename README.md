The folder 'Standard_vs_beta_VAEs' is for exploring how standard-VAEs (i.e., beta = 1) and beta-VAEs (any non-zero beta) differ when it comes to disenatangling the factors while visualizing a dataset. Greater disentaglement is connected to greater interpretability (https://openreview.net/pdf?id=Sy2fzU9gl). I set the 'beta' value to be 4 here for the beta-VAE (as my initial exploration involving lower values, e.g., 'beta' = 1.5, led to milder disentangling compared to 'beta' = 4). Interestingly, when the number of latent dimensions was only 2, the standard-VAE was more effective than the beta-VAE in disentangling the factors. However, as expected, as I increased the latent dimensions to 10, beta-VAEs showed better disentangling properties. In the Python file for this, there is also a visual at the end showing this. Note that even the number of epochs need to be reasonably high for this to be observed (I used 50). 

The choice of the dataset was because it was publicly available and easy to load (shown in the file titled "...2D..."). For visualizing the latent dimensions, I used a technique called t-SNE, which offers advantages over PCA w.r.t. visualization. The former can capture non-linear relationships in data and is better at revealing clusters, although it's less interpretable than the latter (which is OK as far as the purpose is solely visualization).
